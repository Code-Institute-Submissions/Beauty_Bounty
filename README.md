## About 
My e-commerce store sells only the beauty products of the season from makeup, skincare and even fragrances. It's the place where beauty lovers visit to get inspired and purchase the hottest products out there, to make them look and feel their best! 

## Why This Project? 
This is an e-commerce store created for my 4th Milestone Project - Full Stack with Django for [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/). My app allows users to search, view and purchase beauty products.

The front-end display and functionality uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript and the back-end functionality uses Python, Django and PostgresSQL.

## UX

### User Stories
As a user, I want to be able to:
* Look at all the app's products
* Search for a specific product
* Look into different product categories
* View product information
* View my cart item(s)
* Add a product to my cart
* Increase/Decrease the quantity of the product I am interested in purchasing
* Delete a product from my cart
* View order summery and total before proceeding with the payment
* Purchase the added cart item(s) with my credit card details
* Get a confirmation when my payment goes through
* Get a notification if my payment doesn't go through
* Create my personal account
* Login/Logout of my personal account
* Contact costumer service via email or call
* Connect with the people of Beauty Bounty through social media 

### Research
I researched tutorial on e-commerse stores with Python and Django on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) and [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/), to get a general idea of the functionality that was needed to be implemented for this project. Most of my code was taken from Udemy's E-commerce Website Project.

### Wireframes
To create this project's wireframes I used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/).

During the development process some changes were made.

### Design
I wanted to keep my website clean and bright. I used a lavender color for the navbar and footer to add some character but kept everything else white. Navbar brand and icons were given a deep almost black-looking purple. Typography is "Great Vibes" for the navbar brand and "Quicksand" for the body html code.

## Features

### Functionality
The app is using Python login to allow users to register or login/logout to their account for free. Users are also able to add item(s) to the cart and use their credit card to make a payment. That was achieved by installing and setting up Stripe.
